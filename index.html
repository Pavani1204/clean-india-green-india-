         <p id="why2">We all know the proverb “Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” Yet, we Indians have never followed cleanliness properly. There are many benefits for keeping ourselves and our environment clean.
            A clean environment helps save endangered species from going extinct. We can breathe clean air, and there will be fewer hazards. By having a clean environment, we can have a steady supply of food, water, and many natural resources like wood to create various products. Thus, making India green must become the mantra of all the citizens.  
            In this endeavor, the government under the leadership ofPrime Minister Narendra Modihad launched theClean India Green Indiamission.
            TheClean India component, the government wants to make India clean and hygienic. To this end, the government had launched theSwachh Bharat Abhiyan or Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), a nationwide campaign. The mission aims to clean up the streets, roads, and infrastructure of Indian cities, towns, and rural areas.
            TheGreen India component involves conserving greenery in the country and protect the natural environmental beauty. The major goals under this component are increasing forest or tree cover in the country to over 5 million hectares, improving ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and storage. TheGreen Indiacomponent ultimately aims to reduce the burgeoning air pollution in the country.
